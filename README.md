The amount of HTML and CSS in these templates is mind-blowing. The CSS was filled with so many small caveats, nuances, and conditions we have yet to learn about that it is very hard to follow. But in this cave of wonders lies golden treasure. I asked yesterday about CSS variables, and I see in this code numerous *@* symbols that go beyond media queries. What are these identifiers and what do you represent? Also, I'm curious about testing these kinds of things. Does special software exist or do these professionals simply use the inspector and multiple devices, as well?

These sites are so beautiful and so verbose that it is hard to decide where to start combing through and where to adjust. But I look forward to going deeper into the rabbit holes as the project evolves.

I've put only about an hour in to this lab at present.
